          <p>In this increasingly complex world, education is one of the most important investments in life. The mission for Help Start Education Foundation is awarding laptops to promote human potential to BYU-Pathway Worldwide students in Africa.</p>

          <p>Although we are not affiliated with BYU-Pathway Worldwide, we value its low-cost, flexible, online approach to higher education in over 150 countries.</p>
          
          <p>Income inequality prevents many African BYU-Pathway students from owning a laptop, which is necessary to complete university-level courses and obtain their online degree. Help Start Education Foundation addresses this problem by awarding laptops to exceptional BYU-Pathway students through a competitive process.</p>

          <p>We are not experts, nor rich or famous, but we have a reverence for life and a desire to be in helping the poor and the needy. Please add greater meaning to your life today and join us in creating a better tomorrow!</p>
